## Sensitivity
This folder contains the files for the sensitivity exercises carried out in Section 7 of the paper. In particular, we here provide the workfiles for the exercises carried out in Subsections 7.1 and 7.2.

### Subfolder: Consumption_Investment_VA
This folder contains the files used to carry out the sensitivity analysis in Section 7.1 of the paper, called "Consumption Value Added vs Investment Value Added". 

In this excercise, we use input-output data for the US to compute the time series of the High- and Low-Skill Sectors' shares of Value Added in producer’s prices that are generated by final expenditure on consumption and investment (in producer’s prices). Data are available every five years between 1977 and 2002 and anually between 1997 and 2005. For simplicity, and to be consistent with the period used in our benchmark results, we use data for 2005, 2002, 1997, 1992, 1987, 1982, 1977.


### Subfolder: Trade

This folder contains the calculations performed to adjust the shares of value added in the high- and low-skill sector for sectoral net trade flows, as described in Section 7.2 of the paper.
