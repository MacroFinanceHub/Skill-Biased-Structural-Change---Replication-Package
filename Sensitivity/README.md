## Sensitivity
This folder contains the files for the sensitivity exercises carried out in Section 7 of the paper. In particular, we here provide the workfiles for the exercises carried out in Subsections 7.1 and 7.2.

### Subfolder: Consumption_Investment_VA
This folder contains the files used to carry out the sensitivity analysis in Section 7.1 of the paper, called "Consumption Value Added vs Investment Value Added". 

In this excercise, we use input-output data for the US to compute the time series of the High- and Low-Skill Sectors' shares of Value Added in producer’s prices that are generated by final expenditure on consumption and investment (in producer’s prices). Data are available every five years between 1977 and 2002 and anually between 1997 and 2005. For simplicity, and to be consistent with the period used in our benchmark results, we use data for 2005, 2002, 1997, 1992, 1987, 1982, 1977.


### Subfolder: Trade

* *US Trade Data.xlsx:* this Excel file contains the calculations performed to adjust the shares of value added in the high- and low-skill sector for sectoral net trade flows, as described in Section 7.2 of the paper. 

    * **Inputs:** the exercise uses annual data on trade of goods and services for the U.S. (Balance of Payment Basis) from the U.S. Census Bureau, which is stored in the worksheet *Trade*. It also requires a time series on the U.S. GDP, which we obtain from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and store in the sheet U.S. GDP.
    * **Output:** two time series of the net trade flows for the high- and low-skill sector. Due to data limitations, to compute this series we assume that the net trade in services corresponds to the net trade flow in the high-skill sector, while the net trade in goods represents the trade flow in the low-skill sector. 
    
The Bureau of Economic Analysis provides data for the U.S. trade in services by type of service since 1999. We use these data to validate our assumption that the net trade in services is close to the net trade flow for the high-skill sector. Columns I to L in the Sheet Calculated Series confirm that that is indeed the case.
